	<h2>Making Time for Yourself and Your Family</h2>
<p>Because of the stress of a typical work week, finding time for some fun and relaxation is usually difficult. Furthermore, it may seem like making time to enjoy your life takes a lot of effort. However, finding time for yourself and your family is well worth it: The hobbies and activities we take part in together or alone often bring us great happiness and help to enrich our lives. </p>
Why Leisure Is Important
<ul>
<li>Physical fun, like taking an aerobics class or going on a walk with a friend, helps soothe tension and clear the mind.</li><li>
Even an hour of leisure time a day is great for the body, mind, and spirit. It helps release stress and leads to a more balanced life. </li><li>
By taking time to do things that you like to do, you are better able to have healthier and more positive relationships with those around you. </li>
</ul>
<h4>How to Have Fun </h4>
<p>If you’ve filled your life with so much work that you’ve forgotten how to play, take some cues from kids. They easily go from one fun activity to the next, typically with smiles and laughter. Watch your child at the playground and see how he or she becomes immersed in the present activity, whether it’s playing in the sandbox, scaling a climbing wall, or going down a slide. Try to have a similar state of immersion and happiness when you get to take time for you. Here are some tips to make the most of your fun times:</p>
<ul><li>
Choose activities that are just for you; choose others that involve the family. </li><li>
Schedule a time for leisure into your daily calendar. </li><li>
When having family time, pick sports, hobbies, or locations that everyone enjoys. </li><li>
Take time for unexpected pleasures. Occasionally, don’t schedule in an activity for your leisure time during the day. When leisure time comes, do what you feel. </li><li>
Quiet times during the morning can help you get ready for the day, and quiet times at night can help you unwind. Choose meditation or other relaxing, quiet activities to de-stress. </li><li>
Try to be fully present when you’re having fun. Let go of cares, worries, and stress during fun activities; know that you can address what you need to after you’re done with your fun time. </li></ul>
